            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Greetings! My name is David Jeremy B. Ang. I was born in the 19th of September, 2005.
               I like programming and I was inspired by a lot of youtubers to pursue this.
               My hobbies include: playing games, watching interesting videos, coding, and
               reading light novels. I also enjoy watching anime and reading manga. I am 
               currently not skilled in programming, but I wish to hone my skills further
               and be good at what I do. 
               <br>
               <a style="font-size: 20px;" href="form.html">I want to learn more about you!</a>
            </p>
